    <h2>Whoops!</h2>
    <p>
        You have reached this page because the requested website was not found on the server.
        It is possible for various reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The website was disconnected for nonpayment. As soon as the owner will charge the account and include the
            site - it will work!
        </li>
        <li>Site moved to another server, and the DNS records haven't updated. Need to wait a bit.</li>
        <li>The site was abandoned and removed, and the entries in the DNS, leading to our hosting, there are still.
        </li>
        <li>Invalid request. This website we do not have, you came here by mistake.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are owner of the disabled site, you need to go to control panel, recharge and run your website to resume
        its work.</p>

    <h2>What will happens if you will not pay for hosting?</h2>
    <p>
        Service is waiting for 10 days (for paid plans) and then removes the site from the server. Backups are stored for
        another 20 days.
        You can contact support during this time and we will restore the website from backup.
